# Lucky Shrub

## live demo: https://mazenlavey.github.io/lucky-shrub/

This project was one of my assignments for the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certification on Coursera. The goal of the project was to use what I had learned in HTML and CSS through the course.

This website is a template for any possible small business website, which shows a brief about the owners, the services provided, projects, and a way to contact them.

The website is fully responsive.
