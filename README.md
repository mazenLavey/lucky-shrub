# Lucky Shrub

One of my assignments for the Front-end developer Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certification on coursera. The goal of the project is to use what I learn in HTML and CSS through the course.

This website is a simulation for any possible small business website, which shows a brief about the owners, the services provided, projects, and a way to contact them.
